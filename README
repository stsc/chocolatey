chocolatey wrapper scripts
==========================
Chocolatey[1] is a package manager for Windows.  The intended
purpose of these wrapper scripts here is to simplify building/
installing or uninstalling local self-made chocolatey packages.

The scripts are written in the Powershell language.  Currently,
there is a backend and some frontend scripts.  The frontend
scripts are invoked in order to build/install or uninstall
packages (carried out effectively by the backend).
